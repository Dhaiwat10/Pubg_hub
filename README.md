### Merkles
Generate lists of token holders of existing projects with dist amount for THE MERKLER

#### Encourage Project Tokens and Curate a list
We could use dGrants as a hub to create a list of projects and their tokens. (just add project token address to grant) <br />
We use contribution totals as a confidence score? Other voting (ethelo was mentioned)?
